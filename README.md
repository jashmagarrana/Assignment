Java Assignment for Pre-Qualification Round for Java Internship in Kathmandu

Task Description: Java MVC Web Application

As a Java intern Pre-Qualification Round, your task is to create a simple MVC web application using Java. The application should demonstrate your understanding of core Java concepts and MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Knowledge of REST and web programming will be considered a plus.

Requirements:

## User Registration and Login:

- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- Users should be able to create an account, log in, and log out.
- Passwords should be securely stored using encryption.
## Model:

Design and implement the necessary models for the application.
At a minimum, include models for User and any other entities related to your application's functionality.
View:

- Create user interfaces for registration, login, and any additional features you choose to implement.
- Use HTML, CSS, and any front-end framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap) to style the views.
## Controller:

- Implement controllers to handle user actions and interact with the models.
- Handle user registration, login, and any other functionality you choose to include.
## Database Connectivity:

- Use a relational database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user information.
- Connect the application to the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as necessary.
- Additional Features (optional, but encouraged):

- Implement additional features to showcase your skills and creativity.
- Examples include password reset functionality, profile management, or any other functionality you think would enhance the application.
## Additional Guidelines:

- Use Java's core concepts and object-oriented programming principles effectively.
- Use appropriate design patterns and best practices for MVC architecture.
- Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track your changes.
- Write clean, well-documented code with proper comments.
- Handle form validation and provide appropriate error messages when necessary.
- Follow Java naming conventions and code style guidelines.
- Pay attention to application security, especially when handling user authentication and sensitive data.
- You are encouraged to use third-party libraries or frameworks if they enhance the application's functionality.
## Evaluation Criteria:

- Understanding and implementation of core Java concepts.
- Proper implementation of MVC architecture.
- User registration and login functionality.
- Database connectivity and usage of SQL for CRUD operations.
- Quality and efficiency of code.
- Use of appropriate design patterns and best practices.
- Handling of form validation and error handling.
- Application usability and user experience.
- Code documentation and comments.
- Adherence to Java naming conventions and code style guidelines.
